## Yet Another Btrfs(*) Snapshotter

(*) Along with btrfs, we now fully support rsync snapshots.

Currently this is tested on Arch and Fedora, and should work in most other
distributions.


# Installing

## Arch Linux: Install from AUR

Use your preferred AUR handler -

```bash
yay -S yabsnap
# OR
paru -S yabsnap
```

Or install manually from AUR -
```sh
mkdir yabsnap_tmp && cd yabsnap_tmp
curl 'https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=yabsnap' -o PKGBUILD
mkpkg -si
```

## Other Distributions: Install from git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirak99/yabsnap
cd yabsnap

# To install -
sudo scripts/install.sh

# To uninstall -
sudo scripts/uninstall.sh
```
# What does it do?

Allows managing scheduled btrfs snapshots.

* Supports multiple sources, and customizing destination directory. Use `yabsnap
  create-config` to configure what gets snapped, and when.
* Supports pre-installation snaps with auto-generated comments.
* Supports rollback - by generating a short shell script.

## Alternatives

Some good alternatives are timeshift, snapper; both very good in what they do.
However, neither supports customized of snapshot location, (e.g. [Arch recommended
layout](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/snapper#Suggested_filesystem_layout)).
Adhering to such layouts, and rolling back using them, sometime [involve
non-obvious
workarounds](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/snapper#Restoring_/_to_its_previous_snapshot).
The motivation for `yabsnap` was to create a simpler, hackable and customizable
snapshot system.

|                     | yabsnap      | timeshift                  | snapper                |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Custom sources      | ✓            | Only root and home (1)     | ✓                      |
| Custom destinations | ✓            |                            |                        |
| Pacman hook         | ✓            | Via timeshift-autosnap (2) | Via snap-pac           |
| Snapshot Mechanisms | btrfs, rsync | btrfs, rsync               | btrfs                  |
| GUI                 |              | ✓                          | With snapper-gui       |
| Rollback            | ✓ (3)        | ✓                          | Only default subvolume |

(1) timeshift does not allow separate schedules or triggers for root and home.

(2) At the time of writing, `timeshift-autosnap` does not tag the snapshot with
pacman command used.

(3) Automatic rollback is only implemented for btrfs, not for rsync.


# Usage

## Quick Start

- Create a config:
`yabsnap create-config CONFIGNAME`
  - This will create a file `/etc/yabsnap/configs/CONFIGNAME.conf`
- Edit the config to change the `source` field, to point to a btrfs mounted directory. E.g. `source = /`, or `source = /home`.

Also, ensure that the service is enabled,
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now yabsnap.timer
```

You should now have automated backups running.

## Recommended Subvolume Layout

Below is an example layout.

| Subvolumes       | Mount Point   | Mount Options        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| @                | `/`           | `subvol=@`           |
| @home (optional) | `/home`       | `subvol=@home`       |
| @.snapshots      | `/.snapshots` | `subvol=@.snapshots` |

NOTE: The names can be different; you do not need to rename your existing subvolumes.

Tips -
- Mount by `subvol=NAME`, instead of `subvolid=NUMERIC_ID`. This is necessary to allow rollbacks without touching the fstab.
- Create a top level subvolume for all snapshots.

### Example Shell commands to set up

To set this up in shell, mount the top volume and create a @.snapshots subvolume -
```sh
# Mount the top level subvolume (id 5) into a temporary mount dir.
TOP=/run/mount/btrfs_top  # Temporary path to mount subvol.
mkdir $TOP
mount /dev/sdX $TOP -t btrfs -o subvolid=5
# Assuming @ (or root) and optionally @home already exists,
# all you need is a new subvolume for snapshots.
btrfs subvolume create $TOP/@.snapshots
# Also need directory to mount @.snapshots into -
mkdir $TOP/.snapshots
```

### fstab
And then add a line to your `fstab` to mount the @.snapshots subvolume on every boot.

Example lines for fstab -
```fstab
# fstab: Example for root. Notably, use subvol=/@, do not use subvolid.
UUID=BTRFS_VOL_UUID  /  btrfs  rw,noatime,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvol=/@,compress=zstd  0  1

# fstab: Example for /.snapshots.
UUID=BTRFS_VOL_UUID  /.snapshots  btrfs  rw,noatime,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvolid=260,subvol=/@.snapshots  0  2
```

Replace `BTRFS_VOL_UUID` with the uuid from `lsblk
-f`, for the partition where the subvolumes reside.

## Config File

You can create a config with `yabsnap create-config NAME`.

This will create a config /etc/yabsnap/NAME.conf. You will need to edit it and
fill in `source` and `dest_prefix` (e.g. `source = /` and `dest_prefix =
/.snapshots/@root-`). You can also configure other aspects of snapshots by
editing the config.

Once you have set up a config, automated snapshots should start running.

You can see how the default config looks like here: [Default config](./src/code/example_config.conf)


# Command Line Interface

## Global flags

* `--dry-run` Disables all snapshot changes. Shows what it would do instead.
* `--config-file CONFIG-FILE` Specify which config file to operate on.
* `--source SOURCE` Restricts to the config which has the specified source, for example `--source /home`. The source must be specified in one of the config files. Alternatively, a config-file directly may also be specified with `--config-file CONFIG-FILE`.

## Commands
### `yabsnap create-config NAME`
Creates a new config by `NAME`. \
Immediately after that, the `source` and `dest_prefix` fields must be filled
out.

### `yabsnap list`
Lists existing snaps. Example -
```
Config: /etc/yabsnap/configs/home.conf (source=/home)
Snaps at: /.snapshots/@home-...
  20221006143047  S    2022-10-06 14:30:47
  20221006153007  S    2022-10-06 15:30:07
  20221006163019  S    2022-10-06 16:30:19
  20221006164659   I   2022-10-06 16:46:59  pacman -S perl-rename

Config: /etc/yabsnap/configs/root.conf (source=/)
Snaps at: /.snapshots/@root-...
  20221006122312    U  2022-10-06 12:23:12   test_comment
  20221006164659   I   2022-10-06 16:46:59   pacman -S perl-rename
 ```

 The indicators `S`, `I`, `U` respectively indicate scheduled, installation, user snapshots.

### `yabsnap list-json`

Similar to list, but as a machine readable json.

This can be useful to build commands. For instance, with bash you could use `jq` to filter -

```sh
# Filter all snaps created during installation.
yabsnap list-json | jq -c 'select(.trigger=="I")'
# Filter all snaps created during installation, and using home.conf.
yabsnap list-json | jq -c 'select(.trigger=="I" and (.config_file | endswith("/home.conf")))'
```

Or restructure -
```sh
# Show only the timestamps.
yabsnap list-json | jq '.file.timestamp'
```

### `yabsnap create`
 Creates an user snapshot.

 Optionally add comment with `--comment "COMMENT"`.

### `yabsnap set-ttl PATH|TIMESTAMP --ttl TTL`

Sets a TTL or Time-To-Live for a snapshot.

E.g.
`yabsnap set-ttl /.snapshots/@home-20221006143047 --ttl '1 day'`

If a snapshot has a TTL, it will be deleted soon after the TTL expires.
Snapshots with TTL will not be part of any other automated deletion operation.
Of course, they can still be deleted manually, with the `delete` or `batch-delete`
commands.

> [!TIP] To prevent a scheduled snapshot from automatic deletion you can set a long TTL for it, e.g. '999 years'.

### `yabsnap delete PATH|TIMESTAMP`
Deletes a snapshot.

E.g.
`yabsnap delete /.snapshots/@home-20221006143047`
\
Or,
`yabsnap delete 20221006143047  # Deletes all snapshots with this timestamp.`

### `yabsnap batch-delete [--start TIMESTAMP] [--end TIMESTAMP] [--indicator S|I|U]`
Batch delete snapshots.

```sh
# Note: For these examples, assume there is a snapshot as shown in the above `yabsnap list` command.

# Delete all snapshots under all configuration files.
yabsnap batch-delete

# Delete all snapshots including and after 2022-09-25_17:21.
yabsnap batch-delete --start 20220925172100
# Or,
yabsnap batch-delete --start 2022-09-25_17:21

# Delete snapshots before 2022-10-06_15:30 (excluding that snapshot) where the indicator is S.
# Only root.conf's `20221006143047` will be deleted.
yabsnap batch-delete --indicator S --end 2022-10-06_15:30  # :00 is understood
```

### `yabsnap rollback PATH|TIMESTAMP [--noconfirm]`

Shows a rollback script, interactively confirms, and executes it.

If you are a person who likes taking heavy risks, you can skip the confirmation
with `... --noconfirm`.

### `yabsnap rollback-gen PATH|TIMESTAMP`
Generates a script for rolling back.

E.g.
`yabsnap rollback-gen /.snapshots/@home-20221006143047`
\
Or,
`yabsnap rollback-gen 20221006143047`

Just running it will not carry out any changes, it will only display a script on
the console. \
The script must be stored and executed to perform the rollback operation.


# FAQ

- Does it work on other distros than Arch?
  - It _should_ work if installed with `sudo scripts/install.sh`, although
    - Installation hook will not work.
    - And rest of the features should be tested.
  - If you'd want full support on a distro, I'm happy to know so that I can
    evaluate and find a way to prioritize it. Please open an issue.

- I deleted a snapshot manually. Will it confuse yabsnap?
  - No. You should also delete the corresponding metadata `-meta.json` manually
    (it's in the same directory). If you used `yabsnap delete PATH_TO_SNAPSHOT`,
    it would take care of that for you.

- How do I delete multiple snaps?
  - The quickest way is to delete them manually. Remove the snaps with `btrfs
    subvolume snapshot del YOUR_SNAP`, and corresponding `-meta.json` files.

- Why Python?
  - Python, when written with high code quality, serves as an excellent
    orchestrator. This is precisely what we needed for Yabsnap, with a focus on
    (1) expressiveness, (2) ease of maintenance, and (3) accessibility for
    contributors. While low-level speed or efficiency is not a primary concern
    for us, modern Python supports static type checking, making it a robust
    choice for our needs. To ensure code health and maintainability, we
    emphasize strict adherence to code style and readability standards.

## Handling Nested Subvolumes in BTRFS Rollbacks

BTRFS allows the creation of subvolumes, which are essentially independent filesystems that can be nested inside directories or other subvolumes. Sometimes, these subvolumes may be nested within other BTRFS volumes, creating complex hierarchical structures.

When performing a rollback on a parent subvolume, it can be desirable to automatically roll back any nested subvolumes as well. However, due to how subvolumes work in BTRFS, this automatic behavior can be problematic.

### Issues With Fully Automatic Rollback of Subvolumes

1. When rolling back a parent subvolume, nested subvolumes (such as `~/.cache`) may be in use by other jobs. If the rollback operation moves them to a separate volume, they will suddenly become absent. This can leave the jobs using them in an inconsistent state. Moreover this can lead to corruption of the data in the subvolume which will persist after the rollback is completed and the system rebooted.

2. One possible workaround would be to take snapshots of all nested subvolumes while performing the rollback. However, this introduces additional challenges. Subvolumes can be configured with the `nodatacow` attribute, which disables copy-on-write for improved performance. When a snapshot of such a volume is taken this attribute will be ignored, potentially leading to fragmentation. Moreover if it happens automatically it will be easy for the user to miss, leaving the reason for any possible degradation unnoticed.

For this reasons it is best to let the user decide what works best for them.

Hence yabsnap provides suggestions in the form of generated scripts to review and run after reboot,  to assist users in manually moving any nested subvolumes after a rollback.
