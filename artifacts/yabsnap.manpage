.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS

.SS yabsnap -h

View the inbuilt help.

.SS yabsnap ... -h

View the inbuilt help for a particular command.

.SS yabsnap --verbose ...

Enables info loging to trace certain parts of the code on the terminal.

.SS yabsnap --dry-run ...

Applicable to commands which create or delete snapshots.

.SS yabsnap --sync ...

Returns only after all btrfs operations finish.
Applicable to commands which create or delete snapshots.

.SS yabsnap --config-file CONFIG-FILE ...

Use a specified config file, instead of scanning the directory
/etc/config/yabsnap for configs.

.SS yabsnap --source SOURCE ...

Restricts to the config which has the specified source, for example `--source
/home`. The source must be specified in one of the config files. Alternatively,
a config-file directly may also be specified with `--config-file CONFIG-FILE`.

.SH COMMANDS

.SS yabsnap create-config CONFIG_NAME

Bootstraps a new configuration in /etc/yabsnap/configs/CONFIG_NAME.conf. The
config is an ini file with directives that control yabsnap schedule and
triggers.

Minimally after the config is created, the source and dest_prefix must be filled
in by editing the file manually.

.SS yabsnap list

Lists all existing snapshots managed by yabsnap.

.SS yabsnap list-json

Machine readable lists of all snapshots managed by yabsnap. With bash, this may
be piped into jq for further filtering or restructuring.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] [--sync] create [--comment COMMENT]

Creates a new backup for all configs. Can be disabled per config by setting
`keep_user = 0`.

.SS yabsnap set-ttl TARGET_SUFFIX --ttl TTL

Set a TTL (or Time-To-Live) for matching snapshots. The TTL argument must be a
number followed by a time unit, e.g. '1 day' or '2 months'.

To erase a TTL, pass an empty string, e.g. `yabsnap set-ttl TARGET_SUFFIX --ttl ''`.

If a snapshot has a TTL, it will be automatically deleted soon after the TTL
expires. Snapshots with TTL will be exempt from any other automated operations.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] [--sync] delete TARGET_SUFFIX

Deletes a snap. You can either specify full path to snapshot, e.g. `yabsnap
delete /.snapshots/@root-20221006183032`, or specify just the suffix, e.g.
`yabsnap delete 20221006183032`. If you specify just the suffix, it will delete
matching snapshots from all configs.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] [--sync] batch-delete [--start TIMESTAMP] [--end TIMESTAMP] [--indicator S|I|U]

Batch delete snapshots. All snaps with start <= snap.time < end, optionally
matching the `--indicator` will be deleted. Matching snapshots will be displayed
and confirmed interactively before deletion.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] rollback-gen TARGET_SUFFIX [--live-subvol-map SUBVOL_MAP]

Generates a script to roll back to a particular snapshot. It can be redirected
to a file with `... > rollback.sh`. It can also be executed with `... | bash`,
but this is not advisable since it deny a chance to view or review the script.

For certain recovery environments, volumes may be mounted in non-standard
locations. Use `--live-subvol-map SUBVOL_MAP` to override automatic detection of
mount-point-to-subvolume mappings. `SUBVOL_MAP` must be in the form
`"MOUNT_DIR:SUBVOL_NAME ..."`. It may contain multiple mappings delimited by
spaces. Example: `--live-subvol-map "/:@ /home:@home"`. To confirm the mapping
was applied, look for the corresponding comment in the generated script.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] rollback TARGET_SUFFIX [--live-subvol-map SUBVOL_MAP] [--noconfirm]

Generates and a rollback script, executes it after interactively confirming.

If [--noconfirm] is passed, the interactive confirmation is skipped.
